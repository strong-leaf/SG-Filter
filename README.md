## âœ¨ Core Features  
- **High-Performance Retrieval**: Employs an adaptive multi-path recall mechanism to significantly boost retrieval efficiency while ensuring accuracy.  
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Achieves a latency of only **6.13 ms** in single-path scenarios, meeting industrial-level application requirements.  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Supports custom filtering strategies and multiple embedding models (BGE, M3E, etc.).  
- **Visual Analysis**: Built-in tools for comparing retrieval latency and recall rate (see chart demonstrations).  
- **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT, available for academic research and commercial applications.
